# **Derived VIX (dVIX) Token**

## What is dVIX?

---

**Avix Finance is building dVIX (derived VIX), the worldâ€™s first token that tracks the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) in 1:1 ratio.**

By depositing collateral in the Avix vaults, you're be able to **mint derived VIX (dVIX) tokens which will track the real-world price movements of the VIX,** thus giving you a direct exposure to the volatility - the new asset class and an ultimate hedge against the broader market sellof.

Also, unlike the VIX products from the traditional finance, **dVIX will not experience any time decay as it never expires** (because it's not an options or futures contract), thus making it a **much more reliable hedge for the overall market volatility.**
